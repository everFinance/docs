# everPay Protocol

everPay is a real-time payment protocol based on the stored computing paradigm, designed to provide users with an Internet-like payment settlement experience while maintaining the transparency and trust of the blockchain. In the stored computing paradigm, all calculations are done off-chain and the results are synchronised to Arweave. Anyone can inherit the security of the storage layer by re-running the transaction data with the code of the storage layer to get a consistent and up-to-date state.

There is no fixed limit to the protocol's TPS, which depends only on the protocol's application architecture and server performance. As long as the protocol meets the storage computing paradigm criteria, it can be extended "infinitely" with performance comparable to traditional networked applications. Six public chains are currently supported - Arweave, Ethereum, Moonbeam, Conflux, BSC, Platon. Users can top up their relevant chain assets to everPay to experience real-time payment settlement, and everPay will support more networks in the future.

There are many application scenarios for real-time payments for digital assets, such as decentralised exchanges, Discord bounty bots, NFT trading platforms, etc. In these scenarios, everPay can improve the efficiency and security of payments, thus providing a more efficient and secure service for users and developers.

The integration of everPay into our products will provide users with improved payment transfer functionality, as well as an enhanced payment experience and security. We provide an easy-to-use API interface and a one-click integration with the everpay.js SDK, which developers can easily integrate and call, as well as detailed documentation and technical support.
